VERSION 0.1

Changelist =>

23/05/2018:
- added basic search and replace


/****************** Open/Close ************************/
vim <filepath> - opens file in Vim. Tip: add an alias in .bashrc for vi to use
vim
:q - quit, will complaint if modified and not saved
:q! - quit without saving
:w - save
:w <new_filename> - save as
:wq - save & quit. Another shortcut for it 'ZZ'
:e! - discard unsaved changes
:e <filepath> - open another file in the same buffer (i.e. at the same place)

/****************** Modes *************************/
Vim has
1. Normal mode - mostly used in this mode. Vim starts in normal mode. Major
   functionalities:
    - navigate
    - cut/copy/paste
    - enter other modes
    To enter normal mode use <Esc> from any mode
2. Insert mode - used to edit the file
    - edit
    To enter insert mode from normal mode:
    i - enters insert mode at the current cursor
    I - enters insert mode at the beginning of the line
    a - enters insert mode after the current cursor
    A - enters insert mode at the end of the line
    o - creates a newline below the cursor and enters insert mode
    O - creates a newline above the cursor and enters insert mode
    To exit insert mode - <Esc>
3. Visual mode - visually select blocks of file and edit
    To enter visual mode from normal mode:
    v - enters visual mode at current cursor. Move the cursor to desired
    location to visually select text
    V - enters line visual mode. Visually selects the entire line
    <Ctrl-v> - block visual mode
    To exit visual mode - <Esc>
4. Command mode - run commands (vim commands, shell commands)
    To enter command mode from normal mode:
    : - enters command mode
    On executing the command, the command mode is terminated at the end of the
    command
    Else, to exit command mode without executing - <Esc>
5. Search mode - search for pattern
    To enter search mode from normal mode:
    / - forward search mode
    ? - backward search mode

/********************* Basic configuration for programmers ****************/
Vim can be configured by updating .vimrc or through a plugin.
.vimrc resides in your home directory.
Plugins can be added by adding <home>/.vim/plugin directory and then adding
<plugin>.vim files to it.
I suggest to configure Vim through a plugin and not update the .vimrc.

Steps:
1. Create <home>/.vim/plugin/myvimcfg.vim
2. Add the following configuration:
syntax on
set t_Co=256
set background=dark
set path=.,,**                  " Set search path
set path+=./**                  " Add the current directory to path
set autoindent                  " set auto indent on
set smartindent                 " Set smart indent on
set smarttab                    " Set smart tabbing on
set shiftwidth=4                " Shiftwidth to be 4
set expandtab                   " Expand tab to spaces
set tabstop=4                   " 1 tab = 4 spaces
set number                      " line numbers
set showmatch                   " Show the matching bracket
set matchtime=1                 " shorten the jump time for showmatch
set ignorecase                  " Ignore case in search
set smartcase                   " Ignore case in searches excepted if an uppercase letter is used
set hls                         " Highlight search
set incsearch                   " Incremental search
set matchpairs+=<:>             " Add < > to match pairs command
set ruler                       " Set ruler on
 " No Residue files
set noswapfile
set nobackup
set noundofile

3. save the file

/****************** Navigation ***************************/
New version of Vim supports arrow keys, page up/down, home and end buttons; and
makes navigation easier. The arrow keys work in normal, insert and visual modes.

Non-arrow keys to navigate (normal mode only):
h - left arrow
j - down arrow (actually moves down a line, so if a line is wrapped it will
move dow to next numbered line instead of next visual line)
k - up arrow (same as j for wrapped lines)
l - right arrow
gj - down arrow for wrapped line
gk - up arrow for wrapped line
Adding a number to before the navigation key allows to automatically repeat
the action for the specified number. eg '3k' will move up 3 lines

^ - move to the beginning of line
$ - move to the end of line
0 - move to first non-blank character of the line
gg - move to beginning of first line of the file
G - move to beginning of last line of the file
<num>G - move to line number <num>. another way is to use a command. Enter
command mode and write the line number and enter. eg :50 goes to line 50
<num>| - move to the <num> column in the same line

There are ways to navigate based on words:
w - go to beginning of next word (a word is delimited with space as well as other special
characters like '/' ',' '.' etc.)
W - go to beginning of next word (this considers words as delimited by <space> only) Tip:
Try 'w' and 'W' on <space> and see the difference.
e - go to end of next word (word delimited with <space> and other characters)
E - go to end of next word (word delimited with <space> only)
b - go to beginning of previous word (word delimited with <space> and other characters)
B - go to beginning of previous word (word delimited with <space> and other characters)
Adding a number to before the navigation key allows to automatically repeat
the action for the specified number. eg '3w' will move forward 3 words

Navigation based on next character:
t<character> - move cursor a character before next <character> in current line
f<character> - move cursor on the next <character> in current line
T<character> - move cursor a character before previous <character> in current line
F<character> - move cursor on the previous <character> in current line
; - repeats the last 'f' or 't' command without having to type the two
characters again.

Note: These commands are case sensitive. They would match the case of the
<character> specified.

ex: The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.
    ^
'fb' will result in:
The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.
          ^

Navigate based on paragraph (works even with code):
( - jump back one sentence (in code, this will just move based on line
breaks. Not very useful for programming.)
) - jump forward one sentence
{ - jump back one paragraph (in code, this will go to the previous function
level '{'. Very useful to navigate code function by function)
} - jump forward one paragraph

Navigation based on code:
With cursor on any of '{' '}' '(' ')' '[' ']' '<' '>' and then pressing '%' navigates
to the matching pair of it.

Navigation based on bookmarks:
A bookmark can be added to any place and then jumped to from anywhere. It also
works across open files in the same vim session.
m<a-z> - mark a bookmark and name it <a-z>. eg, 'ma' will create a bookmark
named 'a'.
'<a-z> - jump to bookmark named <a-z>

. is a special bookmark, which is maintained by Vim with the last edit's
location. So anytime one can jump to the last edit's location by typing '.

Navigation based on edits:
g; - jumps backward in the changelist (jumps lines)
g, - jumps forward in the changelist (jumps lines)

Navigation based on visits:
Vim remembers the locations you have recently visited (where you jumped from).
This even works across multiple files open in the same window
<Ctrl-o> - jump backwards in location visited list
<Ctrl-i> - jump forwards in location visited list

/************************* Basic Editing **************************/
>>>>>>>>
'y' is used for copy, 'd' for cut, and 'p' for paste. These commands are all
normal mode commands. 'y' and 'd' are movement based commands, typing 'y' or
'd' starts the copy/deletion process ie 'y' + <navigation command>, meaning
they would cut/copy from the cursor till the next movement specified by the
navigation commands in the previous section. A number can be added before the
command to repeat it that many times.

Note: the letters 'd' and 'y' come from delete and yank. Makes it easy to
remember what they are used for.

A special command is 'dd' and 'yy' - cuts/copies the current line despite of
where the cursor is.
Another special command is to cut by character - 'x'. 'x' cuts the character
under cursor. '3x' will cut character under cursor + 2 characters after it.
'X' will cut the character previous to the cursor

'p' pastes after the cursor whatever was cut/copied using the 'y' or 'd'
commands.
'P' pastes before the cursor
The cut/copied data is not overwritten till next cut/copy and can be pasted as
many times as needed. Thus the paste command also works with numbers. So '3p'
will paste 3 times.

Note: lines cut/copied using 'dd' or 'yy' will paste as a new line and not in
the same line as the cursor

Example 1:
The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.
          ^
'dw' cuts 'brown '
The quick fox jumps over the lazy dog.
          ^

Example 2:
The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.
          ^
'3dw' cuts 'brown fox jumps '
The quick over the lazy dog.
          ^

Example 3:
The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.
          ^
'dff' cuts 'brown f'
The quick ox jumps over the lazy dog.
          ^

Example 4:
The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.
          ^
'd$' cuts till end of line
The quick
          ^
Note: there is a shortcut for cutting till end of line - 'D'

More examples:
3dd - cut 3 lines (current + next 2)
dG - cut till end of file
d$ - cut till end of line
d'a - cut till bookmark <a>; this one is very useful in cutting/copying blocks

>>>>>>>>
'r' is used for replacing a single character
The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.
          ^
'rg' would result in:
The quick grown fox jumps over the lazy dog.
          ^

'R' is used to replace the current character and move to next and keep in
replace mode. Helps in replacing multiple characters. To come out of the
replace mode, hit <Esc>
The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.
          ^
'Rblue <Esc>' would result in:
The quick blue  fox jumps over the lazy dog.
          ^

>>>>>>>>
's' is a shortcut for 'x' + enter the insert mode. It saves typing the 'i' to
enter the insert mode.
'S' deletes the whole line and enters the insert mode

>>>>>>>>
'd' and 'y' can also be used from the command line. The use-case for this type
will be to specify the range.

e.g.
:20,30 d - delete lines 20 to 30

't' and 'm' can be used for copy and move from the command line
:20,30 t 40 - copy lines 20-30 and paste them at line 40
:20,30 m 40 - delete lines 20-30 and paste them at line 40

'p' in command line is not used for paste but for print
:20,30 p - will just open a new buffer in a split and display the contents of
line 20 to 30.

>>>>>>>>
Be lazy and don't repeat the same commands! If an action needs to be repeated
again, don't type it again. Use '.' - it repeats the last edit
'.' also works on typing. Enter insert mode and type whatever needed, hit
<Esc> and then move cursor and press '.', the last type will be typed again.

Example:
The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.
          ^
'dtf'
The quick fox jumps over the lazy dog.
          ^
'.'
The quick fox jumps over the lazy dog.
          ^
'.'
The quick fox jumps over the lazy dog.
          ^
'.'
The quick fox jumps over the lazy dog.
          ^

>>>>>>>>
u - undos the last edit.
<Ctrl-r> - redo

/************************* Registers **************************/
Vim puts the cut/copied data into registers. These registers can be thought of
as internal buffers maintained by Vim. They are used for a variety of
purposes. A list of all the registers can be seen by typing :reg .

Vim's registers are named and accessd by some special characters, numbers and
letters. To access them, they are preceded with a double quote ("). So
register 0 is "0 or register a is "a.

Vim has a default register that can be accessed with "". Any text that you
delete (with d, c, s or x) or yank (with y) will be placed there, and that’s
what Vim uses to paste, when no explicit register is given.

When a new piece of text is yanked, the default register is overwritten with the
new text, but the previous text is pushed to registers "1-"9.
Register "0 holds the most recent yanked text.

Register "_ holds the last delete which was less than a line.
        This register also doubles as a blackhole register, writing to this
        register will not affect any other registers. So if you want to delete
        a piece of text without affecting the "" and "1-"9 registers, just
        delete it into "_ register.

Register ". holds the last inserted text (the one you type with i, a, o etc).

Register ":	holds the most recent executed command-line.

Register "% holds the name of the current file. Comes it really handy if you
just want to paste the name of the file inside the file somewhere

Register "# holds the name of the alternate file. (If you have more files open
in the window)

Register "\ holds the most recent search pattern

Register "* holds the last selected text. Works only in GUI versions.

Register "+ is same as "* on windows systems but is used for system clipboard
on other systems if xterm_clipboard feature is present.

Registers %, #, :, *, + and . are read-only. All other registers can be overwritten
explicitly by adding them to the delete/yank commands.

Register "a to "z are called named registers and gives users flexibility to
use them at their discretion.

To delete/yank into a register, precede the delete/yank command with the
register name.
e.g. "adw - delete till the word boundary into register "a.
     "ap - will paste anything in the register a

Vim adds more magic to these registers by allowing users to actually
concatenate to existing registers. To append to any named register just use
the capital letter to access the register. "A will append to the register "a.

/************************* Basic Search and Replace **************************/
Vim's search is very powerful and allows to use extremely advanced search
options. Some of the basic one's to begin with:

>>>>>>>>
/foo - search for next occurance of 'foo' in the file. The search wraps around
       at the end of the file
?foo - search for previous occurance of 'foo' in the file. The search wraps around
       at the start of the file

The search results are updated internally in a list which can be navigated
with 'n' and 'N' in forward and backward directions.

Some shortcuts are built into the system to make searching faster:
* - search for entire word under the cursor. So, if searching for 'foo' with
    '*', it will not search 'foobar'.
g* - will search for the word under cursor without word boundary restriction.
     So, using 'g*' for 'foo' will search 'foobar'
# - will search for the word under cursor backwards.
g# - will search for the word under cursor without word boundary restriction,
    backwards

By default the search in Vim is case sensitive. There are different ways to
make the search case insensitive:
1. ':set ignorecase' - in the command mode will set all search to be case
   insensitive for the current window/tab. To unset it use - ':set
   noignorecase'
2. add \c in your pattern to make that one-off search case insensitive.
   Similarly \C can be used to make one-off search case sensitive.
3. Add 'set ignorecase' in vim configuration file to make it permanent.

Making search better through Vim configuration file:
set ignorecase                  " Ignore case in search
set smartcase                   " Ignore case in searches excepted if an uppercase letter is used
set hls                         " Highlight search
set incsearch                   " Incremental search, searches as the pattern is typed

>>>>>>>>
Search and replace is done in command mode by command called substitute and
called with only 's':
:%s/<pattern>/<replacement>/<options>
Here,
% - search on each line of the line
s - search and replace command
<pattern> - pattern to search for
<replacement> - pattern to be replaced with
<options> - optional, used to modify the search scope and behaviour

Search and replace is best explained using examples:
:%s/foo/bar/ - search for 'foo' on each line and replace with 'bar'. This will
    do the operation on only the first occurance of 'foo' on any line and then
    move to the next line.
:%s//bar/ - will search for the last search pattern and replace it with 'bar'
:%s/foo/bar/g - will do it for each occurance of 'foo' in the entire file. So
    'g' is the most used option and is almost always present in all the search
    and replaces. The g flag means global – each occurrence in the line is
    changed, rather than just the first
:%s/foo/bar/gc - adding 'c' in options will ask for confirmation for each
    replacement. Type a 'y' to replace and move to next occurance, or 'n' to
    leave the current occurance unmodified and move to next one. 'a' is used to
    say to replace all the occurances. Also when using the c flag, Vim will jump
    to the first match it finds starting from the top of the buffer and prompt
    you for confirmation to perform replacement on that match.
:%s/foo//g - search for 'foo' on each line and delete it
:%s/foo/bar/gi - search for 'foo' case insensitive and replace with bar
                /c in the pattern can also be used instead of i
:%s/foo/bar/gI - search for 'foo' case sensitive and replace with bar
                /C in the pattern can also be used instead of I

% is basically a range (beginning of file to end of file) and can be substituted
with other ranges.
:s/foo/bar/g - only one current line
:20s/foo/bar/g - only on line number 20
:%s/foo/bar/g - whole file
:5,12s/foo/bar/g - between lines 5 to 12 (inclusive)
:'a,'bs/foo/bar/g - between bookmarks 'a' and 'b' (inclusive)
:.,$s/foo/bar/g - from current line (.) to end of file ($) inclusive
:.,+2s/foo/bar/g - current + next 2 line
:-2,+2s/foo/bar/g - previous 2 lines to next 2 lines

<Ctrl-r><Ctrl-w> is used to fill the word under cursor into the command line.
This comes is very handy for the search and replace. Its not particularly
useful with / as we already have the shortcut *, but with :s it makes a very
useful keyboard shortcut to remember.

<Ctrl-r><Ctrl-a> is same as <Ctrl-r><Ctrl-w> except that the word delimited
only by whitespace is used in this case.

<Ctrl-r><register_name> can be used to insert the contents of registers into
command line. (Look at the section registers.) Note: here the register name is
needed, so the " must be omitted.

/************************* Vim Patterns ******************************/
Vim search patterns are a book in itself.  Vim provides such a vast array of
options to create a search pattern, it would takes forever to teach them, its
best to just keep learning as you go. Google and find each time you have a new
requirement for your search pattern.

., *, \, [, ], ^, and $ are metacharacters and need to be escaped in order to
use them as normal characters.
. - matches any character
* - matches 0 or more of previous atom (an atom will becomre more clear later)
\ - escape leader
[] - used for any character specified inside the []
^ - start-of-line (at start of pattern)
$ - end-of-line (at end of pattern)

+, ?, |, &, {, }, (, and ) must be escaped to use their special function.
\+ - matches 1 or more of previous atom
\? - Matches 0 or 1 of the preceding atom, as many as possible.
    eg. foo\? matches "fo" and "foo"
\| - separating alternatives
\( and \) - grouping into an atom

Some basic ones that I have found handy in my time vimming:

\< and \> can be used in the search pattern to limit beginning of a word and
end of a word.
examples:
/\<foo - searches 'foo', 'foobar' but not 'barfoo'
/foo\> - searches 'foo', 'boofar' but not 'foobar'
/\<foo\> - searches for 'foo' but not 'foobar' and 'barfoo'

/************************* Repeating commands ******************************/
Vim allows to repeat a command again without having to type the entirety of
the command again.

>>>>>>>>>>>>>> Single Repeat
. - Repeat last change. Can be used with [count] to make it repeat [count]
times.
@: - Repeats last command. Can be used with [count] to make it repeat [count]
times.

>>>>>>>>>>>>>> Multi Repeat
Global allows to repeat a command multiple times in a file. The command can be
called by its shorthand 'g'.

:[range]g/<pattern>/[cmd] - execute the [cmd] on lines in [range] that contain the <pattern>
[range] is the range. Remember % . 20,30 etc.
if [cmd] is not specified it defaults to 'p' - which is print

'v' is the negative of 'g'.
:[range]v/<pattern>/[cmd] - execute the [cmd] on lines in [range] that do not contain the <pattern>

The global commands work by first scanning through the [range] lines and marking
each line where a match occurs (for a multi-line pattern, only the start of the
match matters).
In a second scan the [cmd] is executed for each marked line, as if the cursor
was in that line.  For ":v" the command is executed for each not marked line.
If a line is deleted its mark disappears.
The default for [range] is the whole buffer (1,$).  Use "CTRL-C" to interrupt
the command.  If an error message is given for a line, the command for that line
is aborted and the global command continues with the next marked or
unmarked line.

To repeat a non-Ex command, you can use the ":normal" command: >
	:g/<pattern>/normal {commands}
Make sure that {commands} ends with a whole command, otherwise Vim will wait for
you to type the rest of the command for each match.  The screen will not have
been updated, so you don't know what you are doing.

The undo/redo command will undo/redo the whole global command at once. The
previous context mark will only be set once (with "''" you go back to where the
cursor was before the global command).

The global command sets both the last used search pattern and the last used
substitute pattern.
